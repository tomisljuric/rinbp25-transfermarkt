## 3. Technical Specification

### 3.1 Database Design
Primary Database: MongoDB
- Justification: Flexible schema, good for complex relationships, scalable

Collections Structure:
1. players
    - _id
    - name
    - birthDate
    - nationality
    - position
    - currentClub
    - marketValue
    - stats

2. transfers
    - _id
    - playerId
    - fromClub
    - toClub
    - transferFee
    - date
    - agentId
    - contractDetails

3. clubs
    - _id
    - name
    - league
    - country
    - budget
    - currentSquad

4. agents
    - _id
    - name
    - clientList
    - transferHistory

5. contracts
    - _id
    - playerId
    - clubId
    - startDate
    - endDate
    - salary
    - clauses

### 3.2 System Architecture
- Microservices-based architecture
- RESTful API endpoints
- Node.js backend
- Basic React frontend

### 3.3 Data Consistency Strategy
- Implement eventual consistency model
- Use timestamp-based conflict resolution
- Implement change data capture (CDC)

    - MongoDB
    - MongoDB Compass (GUI tool)

2. Backend:
    - Node.js
    - Express.js
    - Mongoose ODM

3. Frontend:
    - React.js
    - Material-UI

4. Development:
    - VS Code
    - Git for version control
    - Postman for API testing

## 6. Success Criteria
1. Successful storage and retrieval of player, club, and transfer data
2. Maintenance of data consistency across operations
3. Working transfer management system
4. Basic analytics functionality
5. Functional web interface
6. Documentation of system architecture and usage

This specification provides a realistic scope for a 12-week student project while maintaining the core requirements of distributed databases and data consistency. The focus is on implementing essential features with a solid foundation that could be extended in the future.
